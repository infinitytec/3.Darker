# 3.Darker
Scratch 3.0 Darker Theme Userscript using my general theme framework, which can be found at <https://github.com/infinitytec/3.Dark>.


# Install
I use the Tampermonkey extension for userscripts. Get it at <https://tampermonkey.net/>.
Install userscript from here: <https://github.com/infinitytec/3.Darker/raw/master/3darker.user.js>

It is highly reccommended that you also use 2.0 Colors, as it makes the blocks be less bright. Get it at <https://github.com/infinitytec/2.0-Colors>
