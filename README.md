# 3.Darker
Scratch 3.0 Darker Theme Userscript using my general theme framework, which can be found at <https://github.com/infinitytec/3.Dark>.


# Install
I use the Tampermonkey extension for userscripts.
Install userscript from here: <https://github.com/infinitytec/3.Darker/raw/master/3darker.user.js>
